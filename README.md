Netflix EDA Dashboard – Day 15 of 30-Day Coding Challenge

This is Day 15 of my 30-Day Coding Challenge with my coding partner Swara Gharat.
We built an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Dashboard for the Netflix Dataset using Python, Tkinter, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and WordCloud.

✨ Features

Load CSV File: Load Netflix dataset (from Kaggle).

EDA Visualizations: See type distribution, ratings, genres, countries, release years, and more.

WordCloud: Automatically generate a WordCloud from Netflix titles’ descriptions.

Scrollable GUI: View all plots in one interactive Tkinter window.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

Tkinter (GUI)

Pandas (Data manipulation)

Seaborn + Matplotlib (Data visualization)

WordCloud (Text analysis)

🚀 How It Works

Run the Python file.

Click Load Netflix CSV and select the netflix_titles.csv file downloaded from Kaggle.

The app will process the data and generate all plots in a scrollable window.
